          Adullam means Refuge or Justice of the people. It was mentioned eight (8) times in
          scriptures. The Cave of Adullam stood on the old Roman road in the valley of Elah, not far
          from Gath, which was the scene of David’s memorable victory over Goliath (1Samuel 17:2).
          The Cave of Adullam became a place of resort for David. <br /> It was the location where
          all that were stranded, discourage and had given up on life resorted to David to find
          meaning (1Sam. 22:1-2). Adullam became a forge where charlatans are turned into champions,
          the PLACE, both for the apprentice and the veteran, and a retreat center for refreshing
          and retooling (2Sam.23:13-17). It was called “the glory of Israel” (Micah 1:15).<br /><br
