            I had had previous experiences that made me believe God hated me and was trying to kill
            me. I was always afraid trying so hard to please him and know. At Adullam, I learned so
            much about God that I knew I was being lied to. I learned that God is love and he truly
            desires us to know him and fellowship with him. Adullam was truly life-changing

            Fulfilling my calling would have been a nightmare without the kind of training I
            received at Adullam. I have been ministering part-time for 2 years when I realized I was
            not prepared for ministry. I have learnt Theology and been trained for ministry. The
            principles of prayer, interpretation and application of scriptures, territorial
            invasion, and establishment of the reign of God's Kingdom in any culture.

            Coming to Adullam was one of the least on my agenda because of the sacrifices attached
            to it. Well, I came after counting the costs, and I discovered that there is nothing
            more important than to discover God's will for my life and walk in it. Sincerely, I can
            tell you that my expectations were high and my experiences currently are matching up
            exactly with what I need. I'm glad to be here, it's indeed a cave that builds men.

            The benefit of having a structured and regimented spiritual program, really yields much
            fruits. In about three months into the program I and my husband already began to enjoy
            so much spiritual growth. My prayer life has dramatically been transformed, I used to
            think that I was a disciplined and prayerful believer, but it’s totally different now,
            there’s an added grace that helps me tarry much longer and hear a lot better. I totally
            admire and have utmost respect for our anointed lecturers, and our online coordinator,
            making the community experience so real.

            What would have been worse than not making that decision to enroll for Adullam? The
            rigorous and regimented nature of the program taught me consistency both in prayers and
            Bible reading. Talking of Bible reading, hadn't been able to finish the Bible, but
            Adullam made me finish it twice. My most priced moments at Adullam were those 2weeks on
            the missions field; saw deaf ears open by my feeble hands, saw young teenage boys get
            saved and filled with the Holy Spirit at the spot, amongst others. For me, Adullam is a
            blessing I'd recommend for everyone who is hungry for more of God

            If I have to describe what Adullam has been for me these couple of months, I would say
            it is a spiritual breeding ground for everyone who desires to follow God's will. The
            Eye-opener for me so far, has been the daily Bible reading which is supposed to be done
            aloud. I found out this method greatly helps with the distractions that floods the mind
            as we read. I'd say in Adullam I have been initiated into a culture that has left me
            always seeking to do the will of God.

            For me, Adullam is more than a Bible Seminary, it is a spiritual military base where
            kingdom troops are trained. The vast knowledge, wisdom and attention to detail of the
            Adullam faculty and Admin team is very inspiring. As an online student, the experience

            God led me to Adullam on the 29th of January 2022.<br />

            My prayer life has improved; I am learning to stay in the secret place.
            <br />
            Bible study is now interesting, as my understanding has greatly improved. <br />

            Most importantly is my burden for evangelism that has been renewed; what was once an
            obligation has now become something I enjoy doing.
